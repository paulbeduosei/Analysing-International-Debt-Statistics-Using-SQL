# Analysing-International-Debt-Statistics-Using-SQL
Wrapped up an international debt analysis project using World Bank data — and it was a powerful reminder of how data can help us understand global economic realities 🌍📊
Using SQL, I explored how developing countries manage debt across different categories, and answered key questions like:

🔹 How many countries appear in the dataset?

🔹 Which country carries the highest debt?

🔹 Which country has the lowest debt repayments?

This project helped me dig deeper into financial indicators, practice analytical SQL queries, and interpret global economic patterns from a data-driven perspective. Always fascinating when data helps tell the bigger story behind how nations grow, borrow, and invest.
